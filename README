chaos is a filesystem hash based database for node.js

why chaos? because we exploit the sha1 chaotic randomness to store the keys evenly in the filesystem.



the idea: 
---------

the first 2 characters of the sha1 hash of a key become the top dir in the tree, the next 2 become the
child dir in the tree and the rest of the hash becomes the filename. This means that the 1st time you
create a database, it will create 65,536 directories so it can then store keys/files in them. it
also means that while the sha1 has trillions of combinations, the filesystem has limitations way lower
than that. It depends on the filesystem but in general, but my guess is that less than 30,000 files in 
a folder should perform really well. This translates to a max of 1,966,080,000 keys. Cool, eh?
Plus you can store any utf8 string you want, it's just a proxy to fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile().



installation:
-------------

npm install chaos



usage:
------

var db = require('chaos')('mydbname')

db.set(key, val, fs_callback)
db.get(key, fs_callback)

chaos just proxies the fs callback, back to the get/set function so it's what you would expect from
a file operation.



future:
-------

who knows?
it's still just a proof of concept, no real life tests are done.
contributions are welcome! :)
